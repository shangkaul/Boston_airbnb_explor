## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code, it's a plain jupyter notebook. You can checkout the notebook on kaggle too - https://www.kaggle.com/shangkaul/boston-data-analysis-blog

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data for Boston. Some questions that we worked on are given below - 

1. First we just generally take a look at the data and run some basic housekeeping commands to get a feel of the data. Basic stuff like data exploration, null coverage and the correlation matrix to visualize and filter out the important features of the dataset.
2. Then we dive deeper into the data to see what are the common amenities provided in the homestays across Boston.
3. Further we analyse how these ameneties affect the popularity of the property. Also we look at what other features attract the guests to rent a property.
4. Finally, using the property's geolocation coordinates, we see how the location of the property affects it's price. We do this by training a linear model on the data and then analysing the coefficients of the model to analyse which features affect the listing price and by what factor.
